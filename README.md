# Northwind-Traders-Power-BI-Dashboard



Project overview

I treated this as a real stakeholder assignment. Executives want a quick summary of business health — revenue, trends, top customers, product/category performance and operational metrics (shipping & fulfillment). The dashboard prioritizes:

Clarity over complexity
One-page experience : KPIs at the top, trends and breakdowns in the middle, detailed tables at the bottom.
Interactivity that helps decision-making : slicers, dynamic titles, field-parameter-driven breakdowns, and focused tooltips.

This project uses the Northwind Traders dataset, a classic retail and wholesale distribution dataset to design a business-ready sales dashboard for executives and sales leadership. The dashboard was built in Power BI by applying the 7-Pillar Framework, with a strong focus on interactivity, clean modeling, and decision-oriented storytelling rather than raw reporting.

1. Audience First

The dashboard was designed with CEOs and Sales Leaders in mind. Their pressures:

Track revenue growth over time.
Compare performance across regions, categories, and customers.
Identify top customers and sales trends quickly.

➡️ Implemented audience-friendly slicers and bookmarks so users can toggle between “Summary” (KPI cards + charts) and “Details” (drill-down matrix).


2. Business Questions Driving the Dashboard

Before building, I structured the dashboard to answer three main questions:

Revenue Trends → How is revenue performing over time? Which categories are driving growth?
Customer & Market Insights → Who are the top customers and which countries are contributing most to sales?
Operational Efficiency → How well are orders being fulfilled on time, and where are delays happening?
